# Experiment 3: React Single Page Application with Routing

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand client-side routing in React applications
2. Implement React Router for navigation between pages
3. Create reusable layout components for consistent UI structure
4. Handle 404 errors with custom Not Found pages
5. Build a complete Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple routes
6. Manage component composition and nesting in React

## About This Experiment
This experiment demonstrates building a React Single Page Application using React Router. It includes:
- A main layout component that wraps all pages
- Navigation between Home, About, and Contact pages
- A custom 404 Not Found page for invalid routes
- Proper component structure and routing setup

The app showcases how to create a navigable SPA with clean URL routing and consistent layout across all pages.
