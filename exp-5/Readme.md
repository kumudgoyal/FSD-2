# Experiment 5: React Forms and Validation

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand controlled components in React forms
2. Implement form state management with useState
3. Handle form submissions and prevent default behavior
4. Add form validation and error handling
5. Create user-friendly form interfaces
6. Manage multiple form fields and their states
7. Implement form reset functionality

## About This Experiment
This experiment focuses on building interactive forms in React applications. It demonstrates:
- Controlled input components that sync with React state
- Form validation to ensure data integrity
- Handling form submissions with proper event management
- Creating reusable form components
- Managing form state across multiple inputs

The app includes a comprehensive form component showcasing best practices for form handling in React.
